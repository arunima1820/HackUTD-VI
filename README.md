# Comet Events!
## What does our app do?
#### Comet Events is a crowd-source app that allows UTD students to post events such as club/organization meetings, social events, free food around campus and so on. Our main goal with the app was a improvise on the UTD's Comet Calendar, that provides students with a list of, sometimes, outdated events in a hard-to-navigate list view. Our app makes this process much more fluid for the students by giving them a map view and allows them to contribute by letting them post events that they think are worth sharing.
