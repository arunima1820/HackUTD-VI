# Comet Events!
## What does our app do?
#### Comet Events is a crowd-source app that allows UTD students to post events such as club/organization meetings, social events, free food around campus and so on. Our main goal with the app was a improvise on the UTD's Comet Calendar, that provides students with a list of, sometimes, outdated events in a hard-to-navigate list view. Our app makes this process much more fluid for the students by giving them a map view and allows them to contribute by letting them post events that they think are worth sharing.  
## Project features
#### 1. Google Maps API that uses location markers to display events and their description in small pop-ups.
#### 2. An 'Add event' option through which the user can create an event, social, educational, etc. and make it available for all other users. 
#### 3. A calendar view that helps the user keep track of every event for which they marked themselves interested, and find many similar events.
#### 4. This application also helps find all the nearby events happening at a certain date or time.
